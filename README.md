### LARVA
The "**LA**boratory for **R**esearch on **V**isual **A**pplications" focus on applications with "visual data", like images and 3D models, statics or dynamic, with output and input. We are from UDESC at Joinville, SC - Brazil.

Our repository is on https://gitlab.com/LARVA due to lack of certainty on 100% about the openness of the code.
